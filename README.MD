# Repo Clone
## Git clone entire public repository

Enter your user name, and wait until an entire public repository is cloned. 

Folders will reside in the same directory as the program. Check for fatal errors, as some repositories might fail and there is no error checking.

Compile/Run with gradle/IntelliJ.
